This is my Data science project using my own instagram likes, step counts and lecture hours data. 
You can see the website of my project [here](https://hilalsay.github.io/cs210-project/). This website includes the presentation of my project. In the analysis page if you click on the graphs you can see their explanations.

The code behind the graphs is available on the website. Also it is uploaded as .py and .jpynb if anyone wants to download them.
