        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>My motivation on this project was to discover how my daily activites were distributed. I was searching for 
            relationships between my instagram likes and step counts. The idea on my mind while starting this project was does my free time and lecture hours affect my instagram likes and step counts? It was fun to see the results. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Data Source</h2>
        <p>I got the instagram likes data by downloading it from instagram as json file.
             Then I cleaned the data to make a proper data frame to use. 
             I used Samsung Healths app to get my step counts data. 
             It was in csv format and I also cleaned and turned it into a
              data frame. I get the information of my daily lecture hours from my schedule and 
            made it an xlsx file to turn it into a data frame.</p>
